# GELMMnet - Generalized network-based elastic-net linear mixed model

Implementation of a generalized elastic net LMM for (mainly) GWAS analysis. 
It also implements the exact post selection inference method proposed by Lee et al. to generate
accurate confidence interval and p-values.


The implementation is based on Barbara Rakitsch's implementation of LMM-Lasso (https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/LMM-Lasso)
, Artem Skolov's implementation of GELnet (https://github.com/cran/gelnet), 
and selectiveInference by the Selective Inference Team (https://github.com/selective-inference/Python-software/).


The software is released under the GNU General Public License.
